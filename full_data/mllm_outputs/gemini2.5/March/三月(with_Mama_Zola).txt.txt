Ah, my dear child, you bring me images that speak of a different land, a different way of seeing. This is not the cloth of my village, nor the beat of our ancestral drums, but there is a story here nonetheless, a story of how people live with the land and with each other. Mama Zola will look with her old eyes and speak of what she sees.

TEXT:
These painted scenes, they are like looking through a window into a world bustling with life, yet calm. The people are small, but they are many, each engaged in their tasks or their leisure. It is like a festival day in our village, when everyone is out, and the air is filled with purpose and togetherness. The way the painter has laid out the land, with the mountains rising in the distance and the waters flowing, it shows a deep respect for the earth. It is the earth that gives us life, that watches over us. In my village, the ancient baobab tree holds the spirits of our ancestors; perhaps these mountains, too, are sacred and watchful.

The hand that drew these lines, it was a patient hand, a careful hand. Every little house, every tree, every person is drawn with such detail. This is not unlike the patterns on our cloths, where each thread, each color, has its place and its meaning, telling a story that words alone cannot capture. The colors are gentle, like the first light of dawn or the soft glow of the evening sun. They speak of peace, of a life lived in harmony. In our traditions, we use the deep indigo, the color of the night sky, holding the memory of our people. Here, the colors are like the earth itself, a soft brown, a gentle green, with touches of brightness like flowers blooming after the rains.

TEXT:
These paintings show people together – on balconies, in gardens, by the water. This is important. Art, for us, is about community. It is what binds us, what helps us celebrate the harvests, honor the spirits, and remember those who have gone before us. These scenes, they show a life that is shared, where people are connected to each other and to the world around them. It is not a thing to be hung on a wall for one person to look at in silence, no. It feels like a story being told to the whole village, a story of their world, their joys, their way of being.

TEXT:
The men who made these, I am told they were from far away, one from a land called Italy, serving emperors in a land called China. He learned to see with new eyes, to blend the ways of his own people with the ways of this new land. This is like the river that meets the great ocean; it changes, but it also brings its own waters, its own life. This Lang Shining, he has tried to show the world as these emperors saw it, with a richness and a careful eye. He has painted the "Twelve Months Paintings," each one a celebration of the seasons, of life's unfolding. This is a good thing. To mark the passage of time, to see the beauty in each part of the year, this is a way to honor the spirits of the land and the ancestors. It reminds me of our own cycles of planting and harvest, of dry season and rainy season, each with its own blessings and its own rituals. Even though the style is different from our carvings and our weavings, the heart of it, the desire to capture life and its beauty, to tell a story that matters, that is something Mama Zola understands.
