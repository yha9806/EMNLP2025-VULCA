Greetings. I am Guo Xi. Before me are fragments of a depiction, understood to be "Mid-Autumn Festival," the eighth in a series of "Twelve Months Paintings" from the Qing court, attributed to the Western painter Lang Shining. To behold such a work is to observe a different path in the garden of art, one that diverges from the misty peaks and flowing waters that occupy my own heart, yet possesses its own order and intent.
TEXT:
This painting, in its detailed portrayal of courtly life, certainly aims to be "viewable" and, in its intricate rendering of pavilions and courtyards, perhaps even "wanderable" in the mind's eye. The composition unfolds across several levels, guiding the gaze from the lively gatherings on the high terraces down to the more secluded garden nooks. There is a precision in the delineation of architectural forms – the pillars, eaves, and railings – that speaks of a keen eye for structure, likely aided by those Western methods of "xianfa" (linear perspective) that Lang Shining was known to employ. This creates a clear sense of spatial depth, though it is a depth achieved more through calculated recession than through the suggestive veiling of mist and atmosphere that we often use to convey the "high distance" or "deep distance" in mountain landscapes. The arrangement of figures is deliberate, showcasing numerous individuals engaged in the festivities of the Mid-Autumn moon. Each group forms a small narrative, contributing to the overall tapestry of imperial leisure.
TEXT:
The brushwork, or rather the application of pigments, serves this pursuit of clear representation. One observes less of the expressive "bone method" (gu fa yong bi) in the outlining of forms, and more of a careful filling of areas with color to achieve a likeness. Trees are rendered with attention to their individual leaves, and the textures of robes and architectural surfaces are meticulously described. This differs from our tradition of using varied ink tones and textured strokes (cun fa) to capture the "zhi" (substance/texture) and inner vitality of natural elements. Here, the "zhi" is one of careful observation and replication. The colors are rich and varied, as befits a courtly scene and the celebratory nature of the festival. Hues of gold, red, blue, and green articulate the scene with vibrancy, defining forms and contributing to the festive, opulent atmosphere. There is an evenness to the lighting, a desire to make all things clear, which is a hallmark of this blended style, distinct from the play of light and shadow one might find in purely Western art, and also different from our use of ink washes to suggest atmosphere and form.
TEXT:
The theme is unequivocally a depiction of imperial life during the Mid-Autumn Festival. We see figures on terraces, likely gazing at the moon (though the moon itself is but a small orb in the vast expanse of the upper sky in one fragment, its light suffusing the scene with a warm glow). There are gatherings, conversations, and perhaps the enjoyment of seasonal delicacies. It is a document of a specific time and place, a record of customs and splendors. The artistic conception, or "yijing," is one of worldly prosperity and ordered celebration. It doesn't seek to transport the viewer to the untrammeled wilderness or to evoke the profound, often solitary, communion with nature that is the soul of our landscape painting. Instead, it creates an atmosphere of refined festivity and imperial grandeur. The "spirit and radiance" (神采) here is that of human activity and man-made beauty, rather than the inherent dynamism of mountains taking water as their blood vessels and mist as their spirit.
TEXT:
This style, a fusion of Western techniques with Chinese subject matter, is characteristic of Lang Shining and Qing court painting. It serves its purpose well: to document, to celebrate, and to adorn. While the mountains I paint strive to be "walkable, viewable, wanderable, and habitable" in a spiritual and experiential sense, these painted pavilions are habitable in a more literal, descriptive fashion. It is a different way of seeing, a different way of painting, yet it achieves its own kind of mastery in its clarity and intricate detail. The overall configuration (势) is one of carefully arranged abundance, and its substance (质) is one of meticulous realism. Though it may not make the heart soar with the wildness of nature, it offers a vivid window into a gilded world.
