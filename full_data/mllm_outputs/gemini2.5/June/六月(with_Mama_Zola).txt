Ah, yes, this is Mama Zola. You wish for me to look upon these images and speak of them as one of your "professional art critics"? This is a different path from the stories my grandmothers told, woven into cloth under the African sun. But the spirit of making, of showing life, that is a language all people understand, even if their words and ways are different. Let this old woman try to see with new eyes, yet not forget the wisdom of the old.
TEXT:
You show me pieces of a painted world, like glimpses through different windows into a grand house and its garden. This is from a land far away, China, from the Qing Dynasty, you say. And it is one of twelve paintings showing the life of the court through the year, this one for the sixth month, a time of warmth and blooming. The hand that painted this, Lang Shining, or Giuseppe Castiglione, came from even farther away, from Italy. So, this is a story of many lands meeting.
TEXT:
It is a busy painting, full of life, but a very ordered life. See how the houses, the pavilions, are drawn with such straight lines, receding into the distance? That is a way of seeing that the man from Italy brought, to make things look deep, to give them solid form on the flat silk. This is different from how our ancestors might show a village, where every hut is important in its own way, not just farther or nearer. In the first glimpse, with the red mark like a chief's stamp, we see far across the water, with a gentle bridge and quiet boats among the lotus flowers. It invites the eye to wander, to feel the breadth of the water and the sky, even if the sky is just the unpainted silk.
TEXT:
Then we look closer into a grand building. Many people are there, men and women in fine clothes. They are not working in the fields or pounding grain; they are at leisure, looking at scrolls, talking, enjoying the cool air from the water. The colors are bright but gentle – the blues and greens of their robes, the warm reds of the railings, the soft yellow-brown of the building itself. Every little detail is painted with care, like each thread in a kente cloth chosen for its meaning. The faces are small, but you can see their expressions are calm and refined. The painter used his skill to show the light and shadow, to make the pillars round and the figures feel as if they have weight. This is part of that Western way, you see, making things look as they might in the sun. Yet, the light is soft, not harsh, and the lines, especially of the trees and the flowing water, still hold a Chinese spirit, a love for the rhythm of the brush.
TEXT:
In the lower parts of the garden, more people walk and work quietly. The trees are painted with many small strokes, showing their leaves, and the rocks have a solid feel. There is a sense of peace, of a world that is well-tended and beautiful, where everything has its place. The lotus flowers, symbols of purity emerging from the mud, float on the water, their pink and white like jewels on a golden cloth.
TEXT:
This painting tells me of a life of great privilege, a "scene of pleasure" as your texts say. It is meant to show the beauty and order of the Emperor's world. It is not a painting for a small hut, to be touched and used in ceremony, but for a palace, to be admired for its skill and the richness of the life it shows. The artist, Lang Shining, learned to blend the ways of his own people with the tastes of the Chinese court. He brought new eyes to old traditions. It is like a river where two streams meet; the water becomes something new, with the strength of both.
TEXT:
This is a "court painting," meant to serve the rulers, to record their lives and decorate their homes. It is full of detail, a kind of map of their summer pleasures. The "artistic conception" here is one of earthly paradise, of harmonious living, though it is a harmony kept by strict rules and for a select few. It does not cry out with the spirit of the wild earth, like a mask danced in the moonlight, but it sings a quiet song of human-made beauty and order. It is a testament to a time, a place, and the meeting of different worlds, captured with a patient hand and a keen eye. It is a story on silk, and every story has its own truth.
