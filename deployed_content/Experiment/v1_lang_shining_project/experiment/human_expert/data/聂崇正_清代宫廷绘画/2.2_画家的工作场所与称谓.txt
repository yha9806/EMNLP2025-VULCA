清代宫廷家和明代的宫廷家相似，都被分配在某一殿内供職，家不是固定於一處作，經常有更動。家在某宫殿作，就作“某某宫畫畫人”，調往别處，也隨之改變。在檔案中見於記载的有如下名：
慈寧宫畫畫人（雍正至乾隆初）
南薰殿畫畫人（乾隆）
啟祥宫畫畫人（乾隆）
如意館畫人（乾隆）
春雨舒和畫畫人（乾隆）
咸安宫畫畫人（乾隆）
禮器館畫畫人（乾隆）

畫家除去在宫内作外，也經常被派往宫外作。清朝皇帝每年有很長時間住在京西北郊海淀的圆明園，到時就有一部份家跟随皇帝住在那裡，所以圆明園内也設有一如意館，

Apart fromworking in thepalace,painterswere often sent to paint at places outside the palace.Qing emperors would go to Yuan Ming Yuan (Old Summer Palace) in Haidian in the northwestern suburb of Beijing to stay for a long time everyyear.Onsuchanoccasion,some painterswouldfollowthe emperor there,so thatthey couldbecalldinto paint anytmeesidespaintersfRuyiHallwerefrquently despathed tomperial arden rmperial abodentou, dopaintingwork.

“南匠”。這個呼見於清内務府“各作成做活計清檔”，始於何時，不見详载’大概清人入關以后就有這樣的呼。因爲在宫廷中供職，技藝精湛的家或其他兿術家大都來自富庶

人”，但畫家的地位和處境没有多少變化。如果畫家的上看，清代的宫廷家尚不及明代的宫廷家，更無法和宋代的畫院家相比了，其地位可以是封建時代宫廷劃家中待遇最低下的。

Court painters of Qing Dynasty had no specific designation of professional post;they were generally called “painters”.In the reigns of Kangxi andYongzheng,the court painters were calledsouthern craftsmen”.This is because most of the masterpainters at court or other artists came from therich southern provinces.In1744,EmperorQianlong issued an order saying that the painters of the“Chunyu Shuhe Hall”and the“Hallof Ruyi”were tobecalled“painters and not “southern craftsmen”, and yet the status of the painters and the treatments they got did not see much improvement.
