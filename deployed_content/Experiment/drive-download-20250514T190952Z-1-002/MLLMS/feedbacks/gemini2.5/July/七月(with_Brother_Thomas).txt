In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Before us, we have fragments of a larger vision, a portrayal of life from a distant land and a bygone era, specifically, a depiction of the seventh month from the "Twelve Months Paintings" by the hand of one known as Lang Shining, or Giuseppe Castiglione, a servant of the Qing court. Though not an icon in the tradition of our Holy Church, which serves as a direct window to the Heavenly Kingdom and a conduit for prayer, all sincere human endeavor to capture beauty and order can, if viewed with a prayerful heart, lead the soul to contemplate the source of all beauty and order: God Himself.
TEXT:
The ordering of these scenes, with their meticulous depiction of palatial structures, human figures engaged in leisurely pursuits, and the encompassing presence of nature – the distant, mist-shrouded mountains and the carefully rendered trees – speaks of a desire to represent a world of harmony and perhaps, imperial majesty. In our tradition, the iconographer seeks to portray the divine order, the heavenly Jerusalem. Here, we see an earthly order, yet even this can remind us of the ultimate order that God has set in His creation. The lines are drawn with great precision, the forms of buildings and the attire of the figures rendered with a fineness that bespeaks immense patience and skill. Such dedication in craftsmanship, though applied to worldly scenes, can be seen as a distant echo of the monk's patient labor in the scriptorium or the iconographer's prayerful strokes, for all meticulous work, when offered rightly, can be a form of devotion. The artist, we are told, sought to blend traditions from the West and the East. This striving for harmony in technique, this careful balance of light and shadow to give form and depth, may be seen as an attempt to render the visible world with greater clarity. While our holy icons employ a different light, the uncreated light of Mount Tabor, the play of natural light in these scenes upon the silks and surfaces, the way it defines the architecture and the figures, can draw the mind to marvel at the beauty of the world God has given us, a world illuminated by His sun.
TEXT:
The theme, we understand, is the depiction of seasonal activities, the rhythm of life within the court. These figures, engaged in what appears to be refined pastimes, live out their days within an ornate setting. Our Scriptures teach us that "to every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). While these scenes portray worldly pleasures, they can also prompt a meditation on the passage of time and the nature of human existence. Do these activities draw the soul upwards, towards the eternal, or do they bind it to the transient? This is a question for each soul to ponder. The artistic conception, the *yijing* as it is known in that tradition, seems to evoke an atmosphere of calm and refined elegance. If such an atmosphere can quiet the passions and allow for a moment of peaceful reflection, then even such a worldly depiction can serve as a preparatory step for the soul's turning towards higher things. For the Christian, true peace is found not in earthly palaces, but in the Kingdom of God. Yet, a depiction of earthly peace might stir a longing for that ultimate, divine peace.
TEXT:
The style, a confluence of traditions, is a testament to the encounter of cultures. Lang Shining, a brother from the West, brought his native understanding of form and perspective to an Eastern court, adapting it to their tastes. In the painting of icons, we adhere strictly to sacred canons passed down by the Holy Fathers, for these ensure the truthfulness of the divine image. While this painting serves a different purpose – to document, to adorn, to please the imperial eye – the skill and artistry are evident. It may not have been embraced by all painters of its time, particularly those of the literati school who sought a different kind of spiritual expression through their ink, but it found favor in the court. Let us pray that all who viewed it then, and all who view it now, might be led beyond the mere surface, beyond the depiction of earthly life, to glimpse something of the enduring beauty and order that ultimately flows from the Creator of all. May it remind us that all human skill is a gift, and can, in its own way, point towards the Giver.
