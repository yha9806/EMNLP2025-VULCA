In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

My dear children in Christ, we are presented with fragments of a larger vision, segments from the "Twelve Months Paintings," specifically the depiction of "March," rendered by the hand of Giuseppe Castiglione, known in the East as Lang Shining. Let us approach this work not as a mere decoration, but with a prayerful heart, seeking the echoes of Divine order and the whispers of Providence that may be discerned even in scenes of worldly life, especially when crafted with such diligence.
TEXT:
These images, though rendered in a style that blends traditions from afar with those of this land, speak to us of the unfolding of God's creation, specifically the season of spring, a time of renewal and quickening that mirrors the spiritual rebirth offered to mankind. In the arrangement of these scenes, one senses an attempt to capture a comprehensive vision of life. The first fragment reveals figures gathered, some in contemplation by a flowing stream, reminiscent of the waters of life, surrounded by blossoming trees – nature’s testament to resurrection. The presence of a bridge, often a symbol of passage, might lead the soul to ponder the journey from the temporal to the eternal. The architectural elements, crafted with precision, speak of an ordered world, yet it is the natural world, bursting with new life, that truly draws the eye heavenward, for "the heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork" (Psalm 19:1).
TEXT:
The second fragment expands into a landscape of mountains and nascent foliage. The mountains, ancient and steadfast, stand as silent witnesses to the passage of time and the enduring presence of the Creator. They possess a certain majesty, though rendered with a softness that invites contemplation rather than awe-struck fear. The tiny figures tilling the land or journeying with their beasts remind us of humanity's role as stewards of creation, participating in the rhythm of sowing and reaping, a cycle established by Divine wisdom. The very air seems filled with a gentle haze, perhaps what some call 'artistic conception' (Yijing), but which we might interpret as the gentle breath of the Spirit moving across the face of the renewed earth.
TEXT:
The third fragment, again showing human activity within and around a dwelling, with a distinctive round window framing an inner scene, speaks of the microcosm of human life set within the macrocosm of God's world. The interplay of interior and exterior, of human endeavor and natural beauty, can guide our thoughts to the harmony intended by the Creator. The meticulous rendering of figures, their attire, and the very leaves on the trees, showcases a profound patience and dedication on the part of the artist. This diligence, this focused attention in the act of creation, can be seen as a form of prayer, a consecration of skill to the depiction of the world. While the techniques employed, with their emphasis on realism, perspective, and a certain treatment of light and shadow, diverge from the sacred canons of our iconographic tradition which seeks to portray the transfigured and heavenly reality, one must acknowledge the artist's endeavour. Lang Shining, a brother in Christ from the Western tradition, sought to represent the visible world with faithfulness. Even if these images serve to document courtly life and earthly pleasures, the underlying order, the beauty of the turning seasons, and the depiction of life itself can, for the discerning soul, become a humble signpost pointing towards the Divine Artist who fashioned all things.
TEXT:
The colours, though not the symbolic palette of pure gold signifying Uncreated Light or the deep blues of divine mystery as seen in holy icons, still convey a sense of the season’s vibrancy. The tender greens and pinks of new blossoms are a promise of fruitfulness, a reflection of God's generosity. The overall harmony, the peaceful coexistence of figures and landscape, attempts to create an atmosphere of serenity. This pursuit of harmony, even in a worldly depiction, can be a faint echo of the peace that passeth all understanding, the peace of God's kingdom. These paintings, in their detailed account of the month of March, ultimately serve as a chronicle of God’s sustaining grace in the natural order, a reminder that "He hath made every thing beautiful in his time" (Ecclesiastes 3:11). Thus, while we hold fast to the unshakeable truth and profound theological depth conveyed through the ancient and holy art of iconography, we may still observe in such works as these a testament to the created world's capacity to reflect, however dimly, the glory of its Creator.
