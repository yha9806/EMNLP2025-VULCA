TEXT:
My child, you bring me these images, these painted silks from a land far from our own, yet not so different in how they try to capture the breath of life. You call this a "critique," a word that sounds like picking something apart. In my village, we look at a cloth, a carving, a dance, and we see how it binds the community, how it speaks to the ancestors, how it makes the heart feel. This is not about "artworks" to be hung on a wall and admired from afar; this is about life itself.
TEXT:
These paintings, from what you call the "Twelve Months Paintings" by this Lang Shining, an Italian who journeyed to the Emperor's court in China, they show the rhythm of the seasons, much like our own lives follow the rains and the harvests. I see in these slices of painted silk, the gathering of people, the tending of the land, the rest that comes when the work is done. This is the "开冬农闲" – the leisure after the autumn harvest, as the text tells us, for the tenth month. It is a story of the community, of shared tasks and shared repose.
TEXT:
The way the painter lays out the scenes, it is like looking down from a tall tree, seeing the village and the fields spread below. There are many people, each busy or at ease, within their houses and courtyards, surrounded by the earth and the water. This is not one person's story, but the story of many lives woven together, like the threads in my loom. The buildings, with their patterned screens and sloping roofs, shelter the people, just as our huts shelter us. The trees, some bare for the coming cold, others evergreen, stand as witnesses to the unfolding seasons. There is a calmness in the flow of the river, a sense of the land breathing.
TEXT:
The colours are gentle, like the earth itself after the sun has softened its gaze – browns and soft greens, with touches of brighter colours in the clothes of the people, like wildflowers in a field. It speaks of a quiet time, a time of drawing together. The lines are careful, showing each leaf, each ripple in the water, each person's task. This Lang Shining, though from a faraway land, learned to see with a new eye in this Chinese court, blending the ways of his own people with the ways of his new home. He shows the light and shadow, making things appear as if you could touch them, yet he also uses the fine lines that speak the language of Chinese painting. It is like a conversation between two different ways of seeing, finding a new path together.
TEXT:
These paintings were made for the Emperor, to record the life of his court and his lands. They are a history, yes, but not just of great events. They are a history of everyday moments, of how people lived with the seasons. In my village, we tell these histories through our songs and the patterns on our cloths. Every line, every colour, holds a memory. These paintings, too, hold memories – of a time, a place, a way of life. They show us that art is not just for grand halls or quiet rooms; it is in the tilling of the soil, the weaving of cloth, the gathering of the community. It is the spirit of the people, made visible. When you look at this, do not just see a picture; feel the life within it, the connection between the people and the land, the passage of time that shapes us all. That is where the true meaning lies, not in the cleverness of the hand, but in the warmth it brings to the heart of the village.
