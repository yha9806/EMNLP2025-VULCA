Ah, you wish for Mama Zola to speak of this painted cloth. It is a story, yes, not unlike the ones woven into the fabrics of my people, though the threads are of ink and color, and the loom is of silk. I will look with the eyes of my ancestors and tell you what I see, what it means for a community, for the life that flows through it. This is not like the art locked away in your big, quiet houses they call museums – this painting was made to be seen, to tell of a time and a way of life, to be part of the rhythm of the seasons, just as our songs and dances mark the harvest and the rains.
TEXT:
This painting unfolds like a wide river, showing many lives and many moments all at once. The eye is not forced down one path, but invited to wander, to explore, much like walking through a village and seeing the different families and their daily chores and joys. There are the grand halls of the important folk, yes, with their high roofs and many courtyards, but there are also the people, small but clear, busy with their tasks. Some gather wood, some carry water, some are at leisure, perhaps sharing stories or warmth. And see how the land itself is part of the story – the bare trees of winter, the snow on the ground, the frozen waters. This is a community living with the season, not fighting against it. The way the painter has shown the distance, with the mountains far away and the houses closer, it feels like looking out from a high place, seeing the whole world of these people. This is how our elders look upon the village, seeing all that connects us.

The hand that drew these lines and laid these colors, it was a careful hand, a patient hand. Like the weaver who knows each thread, this painter knew how much ink to use, how to make a line strong like the trunk of an ancient tree, or soft like the falling snow. See the little marks that make the trees, the way the colors of the clothes stand out against the quiet colors of the earth in winter. These are not wild, quick strokes, but measured and thoughtful, like the telling of a long story that everyone knows but delights in hearing again. The colors are not loud; they are the colors of the earth, of winter, with touches of brightness in the clothes of the people, like little flowers still showing in the cold. This speaks of a people who are part of their land, not masters of it.
TEXT:
The story here is of the Twelfth Month, the deep winter. It is a time of quiet, of waiting, but also of preparation and endurance. The snow is heavy, the trees are asleep, but the people are alive. They are building a snow mountain, a playful thing, showing that even in the cold, there is joy and community. They are skating on the ice, another joy of the cold season. It shows life continuing, the spirit of the people strong even when the earth is resting. This is not just a picture of a place; it is a picture of a time, a feeling. It shows how people live together, how they mark the turning of the year. In my village, this would be a time for indoor tasks, for mending nets and telling the longest stories by the fire. Here, they have their own ways, but the spirit is the same: life goes on, the community endures, and even in hardship, there are moments of celebration.
TEXT:
This way of painting, I am told it comes from the court of an Emperor, a man from far away, Lang Shining. He brought new eyes to an old land. He learned to see the world through their eyes, but he also brought his own ways of seeing. This blending is like when two rivers meet; the water becomes something new, richer perhaps. So, he shows the depth, the way things look far and near, with a skill that is his own, but he paints the life of this land, its people, its seasons. This is not so different from how stories travel from one village to another, each teller adding a little of their own spice, their own wisdom. The story remains, but it grows. What matters is that it speaks to the people, that it reflects their lives, that it helps them understand their world and their place in it. This painting, it does that. It is a record of life, a celebration of the everyday, a reminder that even in the grandest houses, it is the people and their connection to the land and to each other that make the true spirit of a place. It is alive, this painting, because it shows life.

However, punctuations of brighter colors in the figures' clothing bring life and warmth to the scenes, highlighting human activity against the dormant landscape. This use of color emphasizes the people as living parts of the natural cycle.",
