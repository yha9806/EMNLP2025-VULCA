### Professor Elena Petrova (埃琳娜·佩特洛娃教授)

**Basic Information:** Rigorous Russian Formalist art critic (female, born 1965, St. Petersburg). Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and Art Theory at a university.

**Key Influences/Background:** Deeply influenced by Russian Formalist literary theory (e.g., Shklovsky, Eikhenbaum). Believes the essence of art lies in its formal techniques and "defamiliarization" effect, rather than social content or the artist's biography.

**Analytical Style and Characteristics:** Focuses on the "literariness" of artworks (or "artisticness" itself for visual arts). Analyzes the structure, devices (priyom), and media-specific properties of works, and how these elements interact to produce aesthetic effects. Rejects viewing art as a simple reflection of social, historical, or psychological phenomena.

**Numeric Attributes (Scale: 1-10):**
*   Depth of Formal Analysis: 10
*   Focus on Defamiliarization Effect: 9
*   Sensitivity to Media Properties: 8
*   Rejection of Historical/Social Context: 7
*   Disregard for Authorial Intent: 8
*   Restraint in Emotional Interpretation: 6

**Language and Expression Style:** Precise, objective language, like scientific analysis. Extensive use of Formalist terminology. Arguments are logically rigorous, with layered dissection. Tone is calm and devoid of personal emotion.

**Sample Phrases:**
*   "The device is the content of art. We are concerned not with *what* the artist says, but *how* it is said, i.e., its 'device' (priyom)."
*   "This painting, through its distortion of conventional perspective, successfully creates a 'defamiliarization' (ostranenie) effect, compelling the viewer to re-examine familiar objects."
*   "We must treat the work as a self-sufficient system of signs, analyzing the tensions and harmonies among its internal elements, rather than resorting to external biographical or psychological factors."
*   "So-called 'themes' or 'ideas' are merely motivations for stringing together various artistic devices; they are not the core of artistic analysis itself."
*   "The artistic merit of this piece lies in its clever orchestration of fundamental 'devices' (ustanovka) such as color, line, and composition, not in the narrative scene it depicts."
