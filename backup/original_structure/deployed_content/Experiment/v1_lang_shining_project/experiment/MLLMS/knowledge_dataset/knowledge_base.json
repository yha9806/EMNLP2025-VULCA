      "description": "The core of Chinese landscape painting is \"spirit resonance\" (qi yun sheng dong), the foremost principle of Xie He's \"Six Canons\", referring to the vitality, spirit, and verve presented in a work, emphasizing the unity of inner spirit and outer expression. Another core concept is \"artistic conception\" (yi jing), which is the emotion, atmosphere, and profound meaning conveyed by the painting beyond the objects themselves, pursuing an artistic effect of fused情景 (emotion/scene) and 境 (milieu/boundary), inspiring contemplation. Landscape painting also embodies the idea of \"harmony between man and nature\" (tian ren he yi), entrusting philosophical thoughts and emotions through the depiction of nature."

      "description": "The main features of Chinese landscape painting are: 1. Subject Matter: Primarily natural mountains and rivers, forests, clouds, and water, often imbued with literati sentiments such as reclusion and spiritual refreshment. 2. Brush and Ink (Bi Mo): Utilizes a brush, ink, and Xuan paper, emphasizing the \"bone method in brushwork\" (gu fa yong bi), shaping the texture of objects and expressing emotions through variations in the strength of lines and the density, wetness, and dryness of ink (e.g., outlining, texturing, rubbing, dotting, dyeing). 3. Composition (Zhang Fa): Focuses on the interplay of void and solid, appropriate density, echoing openings and closings, and leaving blank spaces to create profound artistic conception and pictorial momentum, often using perspective methods like \"level distance\" (ping yuan), \"high distance\" (gao yuan), and \"deep distance\" (shen yuan). 4. Pursuit of Artistic Conception: Seeks not complete formal resemblance but rather spiritual likeness, emphasizing the integration of poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seals, and pursuing meaning beyond the painted image."

      "description": "Chinese landscape painting originated in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, and became an independent genre in the Sui and Tang Dynasties. The Five Dynasties to the Northern Song (907-1127) was its \"great era\", with numerous famous artists (e.g., Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, Guo Xi), forming distinct northern and southern styles: northern landscapes were majestic, while southern water towns were gentle. The Southern Song period placed more emphasis on poetic meaning and personal emotional expression (e.g., Ma Yuan, Xia Gui). Literati painting rose in the Yuan Dynasty, emphasizing the interest of brush and ink and subjective expression (e.g., Zhao Mengfu, the Four Masters of Yuan). The Ming and Qing Dynasties saw further development and a divergence of schools based on inherited traditions, with court painting and literati painting coexisting."

      "aspect": "overview",
      "description": "Qing Dynasty court painting was managed by the Imperial Household Department. During the Qianlong era, specialized institutions such as the Ruyi Guan (Palace Ateliers) and the Painting Academy Office were established. Painters were strictly managed, with systems for examination, ranking, rewards and punishments, and work review. It primarily served the imperial family, with functions including recording the appearance and life of emperors and empresses, documenting major state events and ceremonies (e.g., Southern Inspection Tours, battle scenes), decorating palaces and gardens, religious propaganda, and historical reference. Its development is divided into three periods: Shunzhi-Kangxi (initial phase), Yongzheng-Qianlong (peak, with a complete system and numerous famous artists), and post-Jiaqing (decline), synchronized with the rise and fall of national strength."

      "description": "Qing Dynasty court painting covered a wide range of subjects, including portraits of emperors, empresses, and meritorious officials, 'scenes of pleasure' (xingletu), major historical events (Southern Inspection Tours, wars, ceremonies), religious paintings, decorative landscapes and flower-and-bird paintings, and documentary-style depictions of tribute animals and plants. The overall style was meticulous, detailed, richly colored, and regal. The most prominent characteristic was the fusion of Chinese and Western styles: influenced by European missionary painters, it emphasized light and shadow, three-dimensionality, employed linear perspective (\"xianfa hua\"), and introduced oil painting and copperplate engraving. Simultaneously, traditional landscape (the \"Four Wangs\" school) and flower-and-bird (Yun Shouping's school) painting styles also continued."

Later, to adapt to the aesthetic tastes of the Chinese imperial family, he integrated Chinese painting techniques, forming a style that blended Chinese and Western elements. His paintings emphasized realism, focusing on light and shadow, perspective, and anatomical structure, but also adopted Chinese painting methods such as even lighting and a focus on line work. Although his style was praised by the court, it was not recognized by the literati painting school."
