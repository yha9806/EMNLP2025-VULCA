TEXT:
My child, you show me these painted cloths, these "Twelve Months Paintings" from a time long ago in a land far from my own. They speak of a different world, but the threads of life, of seasons, of people together, these are things Mama Zola understands. I will look with the eyes of my ancestors and tell you what I see, not as these "art critics" in their grand halls might, but as one who knows that true art lives and breathes with the community.
TEXT:
These paintings, they are like a river, flowing with many people and happenings. The hand that made them was skilled, like a weaver who knows every knot and every color. The way the land and the houses are laid out, it is like a map of a village, showing where people gather, where they work, where they celebrate. There is a sense of looking from above, like a bird, but also of being right there among the people. You see the mountains in the distance, a reminder of the vast world beyond the everyday, and then you see the small joys, the gathering of friends, the sharing of moments. This is the way of a community, the big and the small, all woven together.
TEXT:
The colors are gentle, like the earth after a soft rain, with touches of brightness like flowers blooming in the new season. They tell a story of harmony, of people living with nature, not against it. Each person, though small, has their place, their task, their connection to the others. This is important. In my village, every person is a vital thread in the cloth of our life; without one, the pattern is broken. These paintings show this too. They speak of seasonal activities, just as we mark the rains, the harvest, the dry season with our own rituals and work. The provided words say this work is by "Lang Shining," a name from a faraway land, who brought his own ways of seeing but learned to blend them with the ways of this new place. This is like a river that welcomes a new stream; it grows richer, wider. He shows the light and the shadow, making things look solid, which is perhaps his way, but he also understands the spirit of the place, the flow and the connection that is so important. These are not just pictures; they are records of life, of how people lived together, celebrated, and marked the passage of time, much like our songs and dances hold the memory of our people. It is said these were made for the "Qing Dynasty court," for emperors. Perhaps for them, these were ways to see and understand all the life in their vast lands, or to remember the good times. But for Mama Zola, their true value is in showing people together, in harmony with the world around them. This is a lesson for all times. Those in big houses in the West, they take things like this and put them alone on a wall, like a captured bird. They forget it was part of a whole, part of a life, telling a story meant to be shared and understood by the community.
